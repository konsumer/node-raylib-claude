AUDIO BINDING ISSUES IN NODE-RAYLIB

Based on extensive testing and code analysis, we've identified a fundamental 
issue with audio playback in the node-raylib bindings:

1. ROOT CAUSE
   - Sound structs in raylib contain AudioStream structs
   - AudioStream structs have critical pointer fields (buffer and processor)
   - These pointers manage the actual audio data and playback
   - The node-raylib bindings zero out these pointers during JS-to-C conversion
   - There are "TODO" comments in the code highlighting this issue

2. OBSERVED BEHAVIOR
   - Sound files load successfully (files are read, metadata is set)
   - PlaySound is called without errors
   - But no audio actually plays
   - IsSoundPlaying correctly returns false (because buffer is NULL)
   - Examples sometimes segfault in complex situations

3. SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS
   - The binding generator needs to be updated to handle pointer fields
   - Specifically AudioStream.buffer (rAudioBuffer*) and AudioStream.processor (rAudioProcessor*)
   - Need to implement proper reference counting or pointer tracking

4. CODE SNIPPETS FROM NODE-RAYLIB.C
   In AudioStream_from_js:
   ```c
   // TODO: Handle field type rAudioBuffer *
   memset(&result.buffer, 0, sizeof(result.buffer));
   
   // TODO: Handle field type rAudioProcessor *
   memset(&result.processor, 0, sizeof(result.processor));
   ```

   In AudioStream_to_js:
   ```c
   // TODO: Handle field type rAudioBuffer *
   napi_get_null(env, &prop);
   napi_set_named_property(env, jsObj, "buffer", prop);
   
   // TODO: Handle field type rAudioProcessor *
   napi_get_null(env, &prop);
   napi_set_named_property(env, jsObj, "processor", prop);
   ```

5. NEXT STEPS
   - Update the binding generator in tools/gen_c.js
   - Implement proper handling of pointer fields, especially in AudioStream
   - Add reference counting to prevent garbage collection of audio resources
   - Test with various audio examples to ensure both loading and playback work
